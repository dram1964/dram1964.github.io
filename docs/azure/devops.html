<p>Notes on DevOps drawn mostly from <cite>Implementing Azure Devops Solutions, Henry Been, Maik van der Gaag, Packt Publishing, 2020</cite><p>

<h1 id="section1">Devops Defined</h1>
<p>Traditionally development and operations teams were isolated from each other
and worked towards different goals: developers add value to by delivering new
features to products, requiring changes to infrastructure; operations teams
add value by maintaining the stability of deployed infrastructure, requiring 
strict controls on any changes being implemented to the deployed infrastructure</p>
<p>DevOps removes this conflict of interest by creating teams that are each 
responsible for both the development of new features and the delivery of these 
features. DevOps teams consist of both developers and operations staff working 
together on a common goal or product, to deliver new features to production 
in a fast and reliable manner. 
This closely aligns with Agile metholdology where the focus is on reducing the 
time to delivery of new business value.</p>

<h2>Key Metrics for Devops</h2><a href="#toc">Top</a>

<p>The key metrics for measuring the success of your DevOps teams are:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Lead Time</dt>
  <dd>The time between requesting a feature and starting the implementation of the feature</dd>
  <dt>Cycle Time</dt>
  <dd>The time between starting work on a feature and users being able to use the feature</dd>
  <dt>Time to Market</dt>
  <dd>The sum of Lead Time and Cycle Time</dd>
  <dt>Amount of Work in Progress</dt>
  <dd>DevOps should focus on the flow of value to the user. This implies that instead of switching from one incomplete task to another, each team member should be working on no more than one task at a time</dd>
  <dt>Mean Time To Recovery</dt>
  <dd>DevOps shifts the focus from Mean Time Between Failures to Mean Time To Recovery. Mean Time Between Failures encourages resistance to change. Less change means less failures. By focussing on Recovery Time, teams are not dis-incentivised to implement change</dd>
  <dt>Change Rate</dt>
  <dd>Increasing the number of implemented changes implies that you are delivering value more rapidly</dd>
  <dt>Change Failure Rate</dt>
  <dd>Focussing on the failure rate for changes encourages the implementation of smaller changes: increasing the Change Rate and reducing the likelihood of failure</dd>
